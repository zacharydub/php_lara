Background
- php was built for the web, hooks in easily to HTML

- start with <?php - tells runtime that everything following is to be interpreted as php
 	- if file is pure PHP, can omit the closing tag
	- if not, need closing tag ?> —> <h1><?php echo ‘Hello world’ ?></h1>


- echo prints to console
	- shorthand for opening php and echoing text: <?= ‘hello’;
- string wrapped with single/double quotes - with double quotes you can include variables
	echo “Hello, $name”;
- semi colon represents end of command
echo ‘hello world’;

- $ php -h brings up available commands in CMD

$ php -S localhost:8888 spins up a server and can then navigate to that URL to see the code output


VARIABLES

$<string>
$greeting = ‘Hello World;
echo $greeting;

echo “Hello, $name”;
echo “hello {$name}”;  —> optional to use brackets to make it clearer that we’re using variables
echo ‘hello, ’ . $name;  —> the period is the concatenate operator
echo "$greeting, $name";
echo "{$greeting}, {$name}";

Using with HTML
- need closing tag
- best to separate concerns, so use separate files


Extracting query params
http://localhost:8888/?name=zach

$name = $_GET[‘name’]; —> will extract the name key/value from URL and save it to variable

FUNCTIONS
PHP provides many built in ones, such as:
- htmlspecialchars() - converts special chars into html entities, used to sanitise inputs
- var_dump() - dump the value for anything
- die() - stop execution after executing the arguments, or can just call die() with no arguments
- unset() - removes from array // unset($person['age']);
- ucwords() - make Uppercase the first character of each word in a string

Arrays
$names = [
'zach',
'zach2',
'zach3'
];

foreach ($names as $name){
  echo $name . ', ';
}

<ul>
      <?php
        foreach ($names as $name){
          echo "<li>$name</li>";
        }
      ?>

      <?php foreach($names as $name) : ?>
      <li><?= $name ?></li>
      <?php endforeach; ?>
  </ul>

Associative Array
- any number of key/value pairs

$person = [
      ‘age’ => 31,
      ‘hair’ => ‘brown’,
      ‘career’ => ‘web developer’,’
      ‘completed’ => true
];

Miscellaneous
- Ternary operator: true ? ‘true’ : ‘false’;

MYSQL
$ mysql.server start
$ mysql -u root —> log in as root user
mysql> show databases;
mysql> create database mytodo;
mysql> use mytodo;
mysql> show tables;
mysql> create table tableName (description text, completed boolean);
mysql> describe tableName;
mysql> drop table tableName;
mysql> create table tableName (description text NOT NULL, completed boolean);
mysql> describe tableName;
mysql> drop table tableName;
mysql> create table tableName (id integer PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, description text NOT NULL, completed boolean NOT NULL);
mysql> describe tableName;
mysql> insert into tableName (description, completed) values (‘go to store’, false);
mysql> select * from tableName;

Can use tools to automate workflow

CONNECTING TO DB
- dealing with exceptions - try/catch
- PHP Data Object (PDO) used to connect to DB
Questions

- When spinning up a server using CMD, how does it know which file to run? Runs the index file. How to choose while file to run?
- colon trick <?php foreach($task as $key => $value) : ?>
- elongated syntax of commented out opening/closing <strike> tags on l4-sql_classes/index.view.php
- unable to connect to DB in l4-sql_classes - https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners/episodes/13
